This comes from the file `big_picture.Rmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this page should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression or a complicated plot. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should also include a small interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shinylive, as below. This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.




```{shinylive-r} 
#| eval: false
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 640 # You will have to adjust this to fit everything

# change code chunk language to just r when prototyping
# when changing back to shinylive-r, remove the eval:false label

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
options("readr.edition" = 1) # keep this to ensure you can download the data


# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----
ui <- fluidPage(

  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),

  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  verticalLayout(
      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                  label = "Number of bins:",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 50,
                  value = 30),

      # Output: Histogram ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")

  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  # The URL below has to point to a dataset on your github pages website
  # I recommend creating a small-ish rds file that has only the data relevant to 
  # the interactive.
  data <- read_rds("https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-final-project-quarto/dataset/loan_refusal_clean.rds")
  # when prototyping: data <- read_csv(here::here("dataset))
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(data, aes(x = refusal_rate)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = input$bins + 1)

  })

}

# Create Shiny app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Introduction:  

Higher education is often seen as a pathway to economic mobility, offering opportunities to reduce systemic inequalities. But does it truly fulfill this promise?  

Our analysis examines:  
1. How **family income** and **racial diversity** impact access to education and post-graduation success.  
2. Trends in **student debt**, **withdrawal rates**, and **post-graduation earnings** across income and racial groups.  

Through exploring five specific questions(in analysis page), we reveal that while colleges contribute to upward mobility, disparities in **earnings, debt burdens**, and **retention rates** persist for low-income and underrepresented racial groups.

---

## Key Findings  

### 1. Family Income and Post-Graduation Earnings 
The **median post-graduation earnings** show a clear trend:  
- Students from higher-income families ($75K+) earn significantly more after 10 years compared to those from lower-income backgrounds ($0–$30K).  

**Insight**: Economic disparities persist even after higher education, with students from wealthier families achieving higher earnings.  

---

### 2. Racial Composition of Aided Students 
- Lower-income groups ($0–$30K) display **greater racial diversity** with higher proportions of **Black, Hispanic, and other underrepresented groups**.  
- As family income increases, the racial composition shifts, with **White students** dominating higher income brackets.  

**Insight**: Financial aid plays a critical role in enabling access to higher education for underrepresented racial groups, particularly in lower income tiers.  

---

### 3. Retention Rates and Racial Diversity  
- Colleges with a higher **proportion of underrepresented racial groups** show slightly **lower withdrawal rates** for low-income students.  
- A modest downward trend suggests that diverse environments **support retention** for economically disadvantaged students.  

**Insight**: Inclusive campuses can mitigate systemic barriers, though additional academic and financial support is still necessary to ensure student success.  

---

### 4. Family Income, SAT Scores, and Post-Graduation Outcomes  
- **Family income** has a strong positive correlation with median earnings after 10 years.  
- Students in the **high SAT score group** consistently achieve higher earnings, especially at higher family income levels.  
- Earnings tend to **converge** for students from different SAT score groups, particularly in the $40K–$100K range.  

**Insight**: While family income drives post-graduation outcomes, SAT scores alone do not fully explain earnings disparities. Higher education helps reduce variation but does not eliminate income-based inequalities.  

---

### 5. Student Debt and Racial Diversity  
- **Low-income students** from racially diverse campuses carry the **highest debt burdens**—up to $30,000.  
- Debt burdens are lower for students from wealthier families, highlighting financial advantages in higher income groups.  

**Insight**: The disproportionate debt burden for racially diverse, low-income students exacerbates systemic inequalities, limiting their upward mobility despite higher education access.  

---

## Conclusion:

While colleges contribute to upward mobility, our findings reveal persistent economic and racial disparities:  
- **Earnings gaps** remain tied to family income.  
- **Racial diversity** improves access and retention but does not eliminate financial challenges.  
- **Debt burdens** disproportionately impact low-income and underrepresented racial groups.  

To fulfill higher education’s promise of equity, institutions and policymakers must:  
1. **Increase financial aid** for low-income and racially diverse students.  
2. **Enhance academic support** to improve retention rates.  
3. **Address systemic barriers** to reduce student debt burdens.  

By addressing these challenges, higher education can better serve as a true engine of opportunity for all students.  





## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* Interactive component
  * Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.  




## Rubric: Other components
