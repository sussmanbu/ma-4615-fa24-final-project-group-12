The dataset includes data from the 1996-97 academic year to the 2022-23 academic year.\nThe data was initiated under President Obama’s administration to ensure reliable information exists to help students find colleges that best fit their needs, enabling them to succeed. The dataset can be accessed using this link.\n\nLimitations of the Data\n\nIt is an extremely large dataset consisting of over 3,000 variables/columns, requiring significant cleaning.\n\nThe sample focuses only on Title IV institutions, meaning schools not participating in federal aid programs may be excluded, potentially introducing bias."

    "text": "Introduction and Motivation\nPeople often view higher education institutions as a significant pathway to reduce systemic inequalities and promote upward mobility. However, it remains uncertain how much a family’s financial background and racial demographics affect things like dropout rates, academic readiness, and post-graduation earnings. This study evaluates how effectively higher education addresses these issues by analyzing family income, average student debt, racial composition, financial aid, and completion rates. Specifically, the focus is on whether higher education institutions reduce disparities in outcomes like retention and post-graduation earnings or if these disparities persist despite access to higher education.\nThis work supports the thesis that racial disparities in income differences are more considerable before people go to college than in post-graduation earnings. Additionally, it looks at how things before college, such as SAT/ACT scores, connect to economic mobility. This offers a better understanding of the role of higher education in mitigating systemic challenges in society."

    "section": "Statistical Model",
    "text": "Statistical Model\nOur motivation for research begs an obvious question: how can you measure whether one college is a better engine for economic equality than another? To address this, we developed a custom pseudo-variance metric that could quantify the inequality in post-graduation incomes partitioned on family income prior to entering college, for each observed college. Available data limits the partitioning to three categories: students hailing from families making below $30,000 in annual household income (an approximation of the established poverty line), students from families making between $30,001-$75,000, and students from families making more than $75,000. Traditional variance cannot be directly calculated for the three income brackets because the average of the three post-graduation incomes differs across colleges, making the variance influenced not only by the spread of the incomes but also by the central value.\nThis pseudo-variance metric measures the aggregate percentage difference in median post-graduation incomes between the designated terciles, 10 years out of college. It is calculated by dividing the median earnings of each tercile by the maximum median of the three partitioned incomes, effectively standardizing the median incomes, then subtracting the sum of the standardized median incomes by the theoretical maximum. The smaller a college’s var_measure, the smaller the difference between the median incomes of the three terciles. For example, Boston University’s var_measure is 3.96, indicating that the university performs well in guaranteeing similar post-gradation incomes to all students regardless of their economic background. Compare this with East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, TN, which has a var_measure of 30.40, indicating that the aggregate difference between post-graduation incomes for each tertile is 30 percent. Through these examples, you can see that this metric provides a tailored way to evaluate inequalities in post-graduation income for each college.\nBefore building the model, our group evaluated our response variable under the scrutiny of MLR assumptions. Because the pseudo-\\(\\chi^2\\) nature of our var_measure, it was known that a quantile-quantile plot would reject the normally-distributed assumption. This was easily resolved using a square root transformation on the response variable. Subsequent Q-Q plots depicted a straight line with heavily tamed tails. Further, a Residual vs. Fitted plot illustrated a random scatter of points around zero, demonstrating homoscedasticity among error terms with expected value equal to zero. The final assumption regarding independence of observations is tricky to navigate, however we decided to ultimately move forward with the model but with more caution than we first anticipated.\n\nVariable Selection\nChoosing predictors for this statistical model involved a lengthy processing method. The approximately 300 variables in the cleaned dataset were narrowed down to roughly thirty of greatest interest. The first issue variable selection posed was significant multicollinearity between predictors. Due to the proportional nature of the datatset, some variables were de facto categorical complements of other variables. To mitigate possible multicollinearity, we removed another subset of potential predictors. The resulting variables, with the exception of ones measuring racial proportions, all quantify financial factors pertaining specifically to the lowest income brackets. These include metrics such as the proportion of students awarded a Pell Grant, the percentage of federal student loan borrowers making progress on their loan, and the percentage of aided students whose family income is between $0-$30,000. A comprehensive list of these variables is presented below. The hypothesis being that if colleges are more financially supportive of their more economically fragile students, then they are likely better at closing post-graduation inequality gaps.\n\nModel Variables\n\nvar_measure: Pseudo-variance metric for measuring post-graduation income equality\nUGDS_BLACK: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are black\nUGDS_HISP: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are Hispanic\nUGDS_ASIAN: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are Asian\nFTFTPCTFLOAN_POOLED_SUPP: Percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students awarded a federal loan\nINC_PCT_LO: Percentage of aided students whose family income is between $0-$30,000\nINC_PCT_M1: Percentage of aided students with family incomes between $30,001-$48,000\nINC_PCT_LO*INC_PCT_M1: Interaction term between INC_PCT_LO and INC_PCT_M1\nLO_INC_DEBT_MDN: The median debt for students with family income between $0-$30,000”\nBBRR3_FED_PELL_MAKEPROG: Percentage of Pell Grant recipient federal student loan borrowers making repayment progress after 3 years\n\nWe considered creating an interaction term between BBRR3_FED_PELL_MAKEPROG and BBRR3_PP_PELL_MAKEPROG (Percentage of Pell Grant recipient student Parent PLUS Loan borrowers making progress after 3 years) because of a suspected dependency between the variables. The theory is that if a student is making progress on paying their federal loans back then they are also likely making progress in paying their PLUS loans back; however, the resulting interaction term did not significantly contribute to model predictability, so it was not included in the final model. Moreover, the predictor BBRR3_PP_PELL_MAKEPROG had a p-value of nearly 1.0000, indicating an utterly insignificant relationship to our response variable. It would not be included in our final model.\nThe same suspected dependency between INC_PCT_LO and INC_PCT_M1 encouraged us to include an interaction term between the two financial aid metrics. We theorized that colleges are likely awarding financial aid to similar proportions of students from the lower income brackets. This interaction term proved to play a significant role in improving our model so it stayed as a predictor.\nWe acknowledged the dependent nature of our race variables (as they measure proportions of a whole), but we decided to leave them in the final model because isolating the racial affects on our response variable outweighed possible multicollinearity issues. This problem of highly correlated predictors was mitigated by only focusing on a subset of the racial breakdown: the most frequent races among student populations, i.e. Black, Hispanic, and Asian.\n\n\n\nResults\nThe final model is represented by the following equation: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n{\\small\n\\sqrt{var\\_measure_i} = 10.6397 - 2.1601 \\cdot UGDS\\_BLACK\\_i - 1.5554 \\cdot UGDS\\_HISP\\_i \\\\\n{\\small\n- 2.0451 \\cdot UGDS\\_ASIAN\\_i + 1.5862 \\cdot FTFTPCTFLOAN\\_POOLED\\_SUPP\\_i} \\\\\n{\\small\n- 6.5651 \\cdot INC\\_PCT\\_LO\\_i - 27.1280 \\cdot INC\\_PCT\\_M1\\_i + 51.8836 \\cdot (INC\\_PCT\\_LO \\cdot INC\\_PCT\\_M1)_i} \\\\\n{\\small\n- 0.0001 \\cdot LO\\_INC\\_DEBT\\_MDN\\_i - 7.3350 \\cdot BBRR3\\_FED\\_PELL\\_MAKEPROG\\_i + \\epsilon\\_i}\n}\n\\end{align}\n\\] This multiple linear regression model has an adjusted correlation of determination of 0.2639308 and a RMSE of 1.145915, indicating that the average error is only 1.31 units off from a college’s true var_measure value. We believe the reason for such a low adjusted correlation of determination and RMSE is due to the narrow range of sqrt(var_measure): nearly all values of the response variable fall between 2 and 8. Because there is little variance to explain, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) and RMSE are naturally low.\nInterpretations of each of the nine predictor coefficients are provided below:\n\n\\(\\beta_{BLACK} = -2.1601\\): A one percentage point increase in the share of Black students at a college is associated with a 0.0005 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{HISP} = -1.5554\\): A one percentage point increase in the share of Hispanic students at a college is associated with a 0.0002 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{ASIAN} = -2.0451\\): A one percentage point increase in the share of Asian students at a college is associated with a 0.0004 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{PCTFLOAN} = 1.5862\\): A one percentage point increase in percent of full-time undergraduate students at a college who are awarded a federal loan is associated with a 0.0003 unit increase in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{INC\\_PCT\\_LO} = -6.5651\\): A one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $0-$30,000 is associated with a 0.0043 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{INC\\_PCT\\_M1} = -27.1280\\): A one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $30,001-$48,000 is associated with a 0.0736 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{LO*M1} = 51.8836\\): For a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $0-$30,000, the effect of a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $30,001-$48,000 is associated with a 0.2692 unit increase in a college’s var_measure (and vice versa).\n\\(\\beta_{DEBT} = -0.0001\\): A $1,000 increase in the median debt for students with family income between $0-$30,000 is associated with a 0.1 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{MAKEPROG} = -7.3350\\): A one percentage point increase in the percent of a college’s Pell-Grant-recipient federal-student-loan borrowers making repayment progress after 3 years is associated with a 0.0054 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\nAn interesting take away from the variable selection process was that the proportion of students awarded a Pell Grant was not significantly associated with a lower var_measure not including white\n\nUGDS_WHITE: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are white\n\n\nthis confusing too: - \\(\\beta_{LO*M1}\\) = 51.8836: For a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $0-$30,000, the effect of a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $30,001-$48,000 is associated with a 0.2692 unit increase in a college’s var_measure (and vice versa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart illustrates the racial composition of aided students by income group. Each income group ($0–$30K, $30K–$48K, $48K–$75K, $75K–$110K, $110K+) is represented on the x-axis, while the y-axis shows the proportional contributions of racial groups to the total number of aided students in that income group. The colors correspond to different racial groups, such as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc."

    "text": "Observations & Conclusions\n\nA slight downward trend in withdrawal rates is visible as racial diversity increases. This trend suggests that institutions with greater racial diversity may provide more supportive and inclusive environments for economically disadvantaged students, which could contribute to lower withdrawal rates.\nIn contrast, colleges with predominantly white students enrollments tend to show slightly higher withdrawal rates for low income students, while institutions with greater diversity show marginally better retention rates. The marginally better retention rates in more diverse colleges align with the idea that diverse racial composition might mitigate some of the challenges faced by low income students.\nThese findings support our thesis that racial disparities in family income are greater before college than after graduation. While low-income students face significant systemic barriers before enrolling in college, the diversity of their college may mitigate some of these challenges, improving retention rates during college.\nHowever, the modest slope of the loess trend line suggests that while institutional diversity is significant, its effect on withdrawal rates is relatively small. This highlights the importance of other factors, such as financial aid availability, campus resources, and academic support, in fostering student retention."

IPEDS gathers data from all institutions participating in federal student financial aid programs (Title IV), ensuring comprehensive coverage of postsecondary institutions in the U.S. The data is collected to improve transparency regarding college costs, graduation outcomes, and student debt, thereby helping students and their families make informed decisions about higher education. Policymakers also use this data for creating policies around higher education funding, affordability, and accountability The sample is focused only on Title IV institutions, which means schools not participating in federal aid programs may be excluded, so it might be biased. There are too many variables, which there are over 3,000 columns. We refined our dataset of over 3,000 columns, selecting those that may have a direct or indirect relationship with race and academic performance.We sort out all possible parameter that are associates with race."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Our tentative thesis is that racial disparities in family income are greater before college than in post-graduation salaries. In other words, while students enter college from diverse financial backgrounds, their economic outcomes after college show less variation. If, under scrutiny, our findings do align with our thesis, then the data suggests that college does, to some degree, mitigate systemic inequalities; however, if our conclusions are not as clear-cut, then there may be room to argue that college, as an economic instrument, is not as beneficial as we may have previously believed.\nThis first graph illustrates that, for all race categories, students whose family’s are in the upper two terciles earn significantly equal incomes by 10 years after graduation. Because average earnings are statistically similar for students whose families make $30,001-$75,000 and $75,001+, we have reason to suspect that college is effective in closing the economic-inequality gap, intra-racially. However, students whose families make less than $30,000 make a statistically significant amount less in post-graduation earnings, compared to their richer counterparts. Additionally, two interesting behaviors that we did not anticipate seeing are that, according to our local linear model, colleges with greater proportions of Black or Hispanic students are associated with lower average salaries after graduation (for all income terciles), compared to their Asian and White counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative view of the same data more clearly shows the relationships between average earnings after graduation and familial income. Although not faceted by race, the general conclusion is that the vast majority of students earn between $38,000 and $48,000 despite entering into college from families making less than $30,000 to families earning more than $75,000. So, although not yet a rigorously proven piece of evidence, this chart supports the idea that college is a powerful force in leveling the economic playing field in America.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 8145 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are currently in the process of merging our supplementary dataset with our primary dataset. The primary dataset encompasses a range of racial, economic, and academic factors across all accredited colleges in the United States. To complement this, we have identified an additional dataset from the Bureau of Economic Analysis which provides state-level data on aggregate GDP and per capita GDP from years 1997 to 2023. Our goal in combining these datasets is to explore potential patterns between racial compositions among universities, state-level GDP, and changes in per capita GDP. We are investigating questions such as: Do states with more diverse college populations experience greater economic growth? In other words, can a more educated minority population, and consequently a more educated overall population, contribute to a state’s economic performance? After we finish cleaning our new dataset and appropriately augment it to our primary file, we will use techniques discussed in class to build plots which allow for a geographic visualization of college diversity’s association with state-level economic growth. As a consequence of limited time, we forfeited aspirations of finding a more complementary dataset and settled for a cross-analysis on education and GDP. Because we are not entirely confident that our GDP dataset will illuminate the most insightful conclusions, we maintain an open eye for possible datasets which better bridge together unintuitive relationships between race, education, and geographic location of colleges."

The data was originally collected and compiled by the U.S. Department of Education on institution-level metrics for the 2022-23 academic year. The data is able to be loaded and cleaned. We hope to see if race is a factor in performance such as graduation rate and test scores. Additionally, we will measure the relationship between parents’ loan amounts, race, and college performance, in an attempt to highlight any financial barriers different races may face in coming to college. A potential challenge can be cleaning the data since there are over 3000+ columns of data.\nFreshman Intentions to Major in S&E Fields https://data.world/nsf/freshman-intentions-to-major-in-s-e-fields\nThere are 7 columns and 18 rows. It is collected by Higher Education Research Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, special tabulations (2014) of the Survey of the American Freshman. The intention of this dataset is to see American Freshman’s intentions to different majors by race and gender. The major question I hope to address is what are the most popular majors among American Freshman across different racial and gender groups. I am able to load and clean this dataset. My challenge is that there may be limitations because of insufficient data. The data is from one college in a year.\nMedical Student Mental Health https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/medical-student-mental-health?resource=download\nThere are 886 rows and 20 columns in the dataset and was designed to explore the empathy, mental health, and burnout levels of medical students in Switzerland. It consists of various demographic factors such as age, gender, year of study, along with internal measures like job satisfaction, empathy, depression, anxiety, and burnout levels. The data was collected through self-reported surveys and psychological tests. While the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, some minor cleaning may be needed to address missing data or outliers. We hope to examine whether health status and study hours are linked to depression and anxiety levels, and if years of study and job satisfaction influence burnout and empathy levels among the students."

    "text": "We cleaned the data by manually going through the dataset and selecting columns that are relevant to our study. We were guided by information which may help highlight racial inequalities within the U.S.’s post-secondary education system. We focused on important variables such as completion rates for different races, percent of students who received Pell Grants, SAT and ACT test scores, and family income. The following is a preliminary analysis on of data after a first sweep of cleaning.\nA cursory inspection of the distribution of the share of faculty of each race shows no unusual observations. Although comparatively a rare occurrence, it is not surprising that a college’s entire faculty could be all Asian, Black, Hispanic, or White, as—for example—HBCUs and HCIs are common institutions. It appears that the distribution for each racial minority’s share of their school’s faculty is skewed right, whereas the distribution for White is slightly skewed left. Again, this aligns with our expectation: professorship seems to be a traditionally White role, historically offered only to those with wealth and privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot more White and Hispanic students being counted compared to Native Hawaiian/Pacific and Black students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis box plot shows differences in completion rates by race at four-year institutions. Asian students have the highest completion rates and Black students have the lowest completion rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot illustrates the distribution of undergraduate enrollment proportions across different racial and ethnic groups. This shows that White students are the most represented group, while AIAN and NHPI students have significantly lower representation."

    "text": "This graph demonstrates the percentage change in population by year, for each state. (We would like to find a way to better represent this information so that the plot is less crowded by state-dependent information. A potential solution is to only include states with the greatest percent changes in population, or rather, if our claim encourages it, include all states with roughly constant growth to showcase a lack of erratic population explosions—but, we digress.) The first insight that this plot provides is that not all states are seeing increasing populations. Some states are experiencing repeated percent changes below that 0-change axis. We hope to use our racial education dataset and linear modeling to find an association between a state’s growth and available educational opportunities for minorities. Further, we will combine this population dataset with our GDP dataset to gleam a more nuanced picture of economic performance among the states. This allows for a better proxy of economic prosperity, which can be used in conjunction with our primary dataset to find influences of diverse college enrollment on a state’s economic growth.\nHere is our code and subsequent output from combining our GDP and population dataset, yielding an economic proxy. Although this was extensive work just to derive data on GDP per capita for a range of years, we can assure the reader that we were also acutely aware of the work involved and exhausted many options before making our own dataset.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nGDP = read_csv(\"dataset/GDP.csv\")\nPopulation = read_csv(\"dataset/Population.csv\")\n\nstate_names &lt;- c(\"Alaska\", \"Alabama\", \"Arkansas\", \"Arizona\", \"California\", \"Colorado\", \n                 \"Connecticut\", \"Delaware\", \"Florida\", \"Georgia\", \"Hawaii\", \"Iowa\", \n                 \"Idaho\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Kansas\", \"Kentucky\", \"Louisiana\", \n                 \"Massachusetts\", \"Maryland\", \"Maine\", \"Michigan\", \"Minnesota\", \n                 \"Missouri\", \"Mississippi\", \"Montana\", \"North Carolina\", \"North Dakota\", \n                 \"Nebraska\", \"New Hampshire\", \"New Jersey\", \"New Mexico\", \"Nevada\", \n                 \"New York\", \"Ohio\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Oregon\", \"Pennsylvania\", \"Rhode Island\", \n                 \"South Carolina\", \"South Dakota\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas\", \"Utah\", \n                 \"Virginia\", \"Vermont\", \"Wisconsin\", \"West Virginia\", \"Wyoming\")\ncolnames(Population)[1:length(state_names) + 1] &lt;- state_names\n\nPopulation_long &lt;- Population %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -observation_date, \n    names_to = \"State\",       \n    values_to = \"Population\" \n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Year = as.numeric(substr(observation_date, 1, 4)), \n    State = gsub(\"POP$\", \"\", State)                   \n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(State, Year, Population)                     \n\nGDP_long &lt;- GDP %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = as.character(1997:2023), \n    names_to = \"Year\",            \n    values_to = \"GDP_Value\"        \n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))  \n\ncombined_data &lt;- GDP_long |&gt; \n  left_join(Population_long, by = c(\"GeoName\" = \"State\", \"Year\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(GDP_per_Capita = GDP_Value / Population)\ncombined_data &lt;- GDP_long |&gt; \n  left_join(Population_long, by = c(\"GeoName\" = \"State\", \"Year\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(GDP_per_Capita = GDP_Value / Population)\ngdp_per_capita_bar_data &lt;- combined_data |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 2023 & !is.na(GDP_per_Capita)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(GDP_per_Capita))                    \n\nggplot(gdp_per_capita_bar_data, aes(x = reorder(GeoName, GDP_per_Capita), y = GDP_per_Capita)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightblue\") +  \n  coord_flip() +                                   \n  labs(\n    title = \"GDP Per Capita by State (2023)\",\n    x = \"State\",\n    y = \"GDP Per Capita\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, New York, Massachusetts, and California had the highest GDP per capita while states such as Mississippi, West Virginia, and Arkansas had the lowest.

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components.
