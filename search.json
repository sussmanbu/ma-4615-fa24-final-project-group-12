    "text": "Introduction and Motivation\nPeople often view higher education institutions as a significant pathway to reduce systemic inequalities and promote upward mobility. However, it remains uncertain how much a family’s financial background and racial demographics affect things like dropout rates, academic readiness, and post-graduation earnings. This study evaluates how effectively higher education addresses these issues by analyzing family income, average student debt, racial composition, financial aid, and completion rates. Specifically, the focus is on whether higher education institutions reduce disparities in outcomes like retention and post-graduation earnings or if these disparities persist despite access to higher education.\nThis work supports the thesis that racial disparities in income differences are more considerable before people go to college than in post-graduation earnings. Additionally, it looks at how things before college, such as SAT/ACT scores, connect to economic mobility. This offers a better understanding of the role of higher education in mitigating systemic challenges in society."

    "section": "Statistical Model",
    "text": "Statistical Model\nOur motivation for research begs an obvious question: how can you measure whether one college is a better engine for economic equality than another? To address this, we developed a custom pseudo-variance metric that could quantify the inequality in post-graduation incomes partitioned on family income prior to entering college, for each observed college. Available data limits the partitioning to three categories: students hailing from families making below $30,000 in annual household income (an approximation of the established poverty line), students from families making between $30,001-$75,000, and students from families making more than $75,000. Traditional variance cannot be directly calculated for the three income brackets because the average of the three post-graduation incomes differs across colleges, making the variance influenced not only by the spread of the incomes but also by the central value.\nThis pseudo-variance metric measures the aggregate percentage difference in median post-graduation incomes between the designated terciles, 10 years out of college. It is calculated by dividing the median earnings of each tercile by the maximum median of the three partitioned incomes, effectively standardizing the median incomes, then subtracting the sum of the standardized median incomes by the theoretical maximum. The smaller a college’s var_measure, the smaller the difference between the median incomes of the three terciles. For example, Boston University’s var_measure is 3.96, indicating that the university performs well in guaranteeing similar post-gradation incomes to all students regardless of their economic background. Compare this with East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, TN, which has a var_measure of 30.40, indicating that the aggregate difference between post-graduation incomes for each tertile is 30 percent. Through these examples, you can see that this metric provides a tailored way to evaluate inequalities in post-graduation income for each college.\nBefore building the model, our group evaluated our response variable under the scrutiny of MLR assumptions. Because the pseudo-\\(\\chi^2\\) nature of our var_measure, it was known that a quantile-quantile plot would reject the normally-distributed assumption. This was easily resolved using a square root transformation on the response variable. Subsequent Q-Q plots depicted a straight line with heavily tamed tails. Further, a Residual vs. Fitted plot illustrated a random scatter of points around zero, demonstrating homoscedasticity among error terms with expected value equal to zero. The final assumption regarding independence of observations is tricky to navigate, however we decided to ultimately move forward with the model but with more caution than we first anticipated.\n\nVariable Selection\nChoosing predictors for this statistical model involved a lengthy processing method. The approximately 300 variables in the cleaned dataset were narrowed down to roughly thirty of greatest interest. The first issue variable selection posed was significant multicollinearity between predictors. Due to the proportional nature of the datatset, some variables were de facto categorical complements of other variables. To mitigate possible multicollinearity, we removed another subset of potential predictors. The resulting variables, with the exception of ones measuring racial proportions, all quantify financial factors pertaining specifically to the lowest income brackets. These include metrics such as the proportion of students awarded a Pell Grant, the percentage of federal student loan borrowers making progress on their loan, and the percentage of aided students whose family income is between $0-$30,000. A comprehensive list of these variables is presented below. The hypothesis being that if colleges are more financially supportive of their more economically fragile students, then they are likely better at closing post-graduation inequality gaps.\n\nModel Variables\n\nvar_measure: Pseudo-variance metric for measuring post-graduation income equality\nUGDS_BLACK: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are black\nUGDS_HISP: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are Hispanic\nUGDS_ASIAN: Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are Asian\nFTFTPCTFLOAN_POOLED_SUPP: Percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students awarded a federal loan\nINC_PCT_LO: Percentage of aided students whose family income is between $0-$30,000\nINC_PCT_M1: Percentage of aided students with family incomes between $30,001-$48,000\nINC_PCT_LO*INC_PCT_M1: Interaction term between INC_PCT_LO and INC_PCT_M1\nLO_INC_DEBT_MDN: The median debt for students with family income between $0-$30,000”\nBBRR3_FED_PELL_MAKEPROG: Percentage of Pell Grant recipient federal student loan borrowers making repayment progress after 3 years\n\nWe considered creating an interaction term between BBRR3_FED_PELL_MAKEPROG and BBRR3_PP_PELL_MAKEPROG (Percentage of Pell Grant recipient student Parent PLUS Loan borrowers making progress after 3 years) because of a suspected dependency between the variables. The theory is that if a student is making progress on paying their federal loans back then they are also likely making progress in paying their PLUS loans back; however, the resulting interaction term did not significantly contribute to model predictability, so it was not included in the final model. Moreover, the predictor BBRR3_PP_PELL_MAKEPROG had a p-value of nearly 1.0000, indicating an utterly insignificant relationship to our response variable. It would not be included in our final model.\nThe same suspected dependency between INC_PCT_LO and INC_PCT_M1 encouraged us to include an interaction term between the two financial aid metrics. We theorized that colleges are likely awarding financial aid to similar proportions of students from the lower income brackets. This interaction term proved to play a significant role in improving our model so it stayed as a predictor.\nWe acknowledged the dependent nature of our race variables (as they measure proportions of a whole), but we decided to leave them in the final model because isolating the racial affects on our response variable outweighed possible multicollinearity issues. This problem of highly correlated predictors was mitigated by only focusing on a subset of the racial breakdown: the most frequent races among student populations, i.e. Black, Hispanic, and Asian.\n\n\n\nResults\nThe final model is represented by the following equation:\n\\({\\small{\\sqrt{var\\_measure_i} = 10.6397 - 2.1601 \\cdot UGDS\\_BLACK\\_i - 1.5554 \\cdot UGDS\\_HISP\\_i - 2.0451 \\cdot UGDS\\_ASIAN\\_i}}\\) \\({\\small + 1.5862 \\cdot FTFTPCTFLOAN\\_POOLED\\_SUPP\\_i - 6.5651 \\cdot INC\\_PCT\\_LO\\_i - 27.1280 \\cdot INC\\_PCT\\_M1\\_i}\\) \\({\\small + 51.8836 \\cdot (INC\\_PCT\\_LO \\cdot INC\\_PCT\\_M1)_i - 0.0001 \\cdot LO\\_INC\\_DEBT\\_MDN\\_i}\\) \\({\\small - 7.3350 \\cdot BBRR3\\_FED\\_PELL\\_MAKEPROG\\_i + \\epsilon\\_i}\\)\nThis multiple linear regression model has an adjusted correlation of determination of 0.2639308 and a RMSE of 1.145915, indicating that the average error is only 1.31 units off from a college’s true var_measure value. We believe the reason for such a low adjusted correlation of determination and RMSE is due to the narrow range of sqrt(var_measure): nearly all values of the response variable fall between 2 and 8. Because there is little variance to explain, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) and RMSE are naturally low.\nInterpretations of each of the nine predictor coefficients are provided below:\n\n\\(\\beta_{BLACK} = -2.1601\\): A one percentage point increase in the share of Black students at a college is associated with a 0.0005 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{HISP} = -1.5554\\): A one percentage point increase in the share of Hispanic students at a college is associated with a 0.0002 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{ASIAN} = -2.0451\\): A one percentage point increase in the share of Asian students at a college is associated with a 0.0004 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{PCTFLOAN} = 1.5862\\): A one percentage point increase in percent of full-time undergraduate students at a college who are awarded a federal loan is associated with a 0.0003 unit increase in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{INC\\_PCT\\_LO} = -6.5651\\): A one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $0-$30,000 is associated with a 0.0043 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{INC\\_PCT\\_M1} = -27.1280\\): A one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $30,001-$48,000 is associated with a 0.0736 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{LO*M1} = 51.8836\\): For a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $0-$30,000, the effect of a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between $30,001-$48,000 is associated with a 0.2692 unit increase in a college’s var_measure (and vice versa).\n\\(\\beta_{DEBT} = -0.0001\\): A $1,000 increase in the median debt for students with family income between $0-$30,000 is associated with a 0.1 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\\(\\beta_{MAKEPROG} = -7.3350\\): A one percentage point increase in the percent of a college’s Pell-Grant-recipient federal-student-loan borrowers making repayment progress after 3 years is associated with a 0.0054 unit decrease in a college’s var_measure.\n\nAs the model suggests, more diverse college campuses are, counter-intuitively, associated with a lower var_measure, indicating greater equality in post-graduation earnings. We suspect this actually reads nothing about the college’s capacity to help students, but is instead the natural consequence of less variation in the racial makeup of a school. If a university’s student body is more diverse, we could expect more variation in post-graduation earnings, on grounds that race plays a societal role in finding jobs after college. A related and interesting finding was that the proportion of White students at a college had no statistically significant influence on var_measure.\nAnother curious finding, this time from the variable selection process, was that the proportion of students awarded a Pell Grant at a college was not significantly associated with a lower var_measure metric. This seems suspicious seeing that if a college has a greater share of students who have been awarded federal grants, one would predict that family income would play less of a role in determining a student’s post-graduation income.\nAlthough the assumptions for linear regression do hold, albeit loosely, there are some factors which further limit the certainty of our conclusions. First is our var_measure variable. Although the pseudo-variance metric does give a rough proxy for measuring disparities between post-graduation earnings between students by income bracket, it is not a mathematically rigorous estimation. Future research could benefit from a weighted metric that places more weight on different income brackets being closer or further from the median post-graduation earnings. Moreover, the var_measure variable is constructed by finding variance between three median values. This averaging-pipeline of averages of averages only gives crude estimations of the true metric of interest. Future exploration should look for college data banks which report all available incomes of its graduates, measured before any aggregate functions have been applied. In a similar vain, the second factor which heavily limits accurate predictions is the proportional and aggregate nature of the dataset. It’s impossible to find much disparity between each college’s predictor values because each college-level measurement has already been regressed towards some average value. This lack of variance in each predictor likely affected our ability to describe variation within the response variable, causing the predictability of the model to fall short. With this is mind, we can confidently state that this model does provide a rough proxy for the relationship between certain economic factors, educational burdens, race, and post-graduation income inequality."

The three distributions showcase the varying post-graduate earnings of students from the lowest income tercile to the highest tercile. The horizontal axis indicates the income group while the vertical axis reports the median post-graduation earning.\n\nObservations & Conclusions\n\nMedian earnings increase as family income increases\nEach distribution is skewed right, indicating that few colleges enable the median student to earn more than roughly $60,000 in annual earnings. This is likely the result of aggregate data which suppresses variation.\nThe median median-post-graduation earnings for the lowest tercile ($0-$30,000) is $39,666 but only $53,367 for the highest tercile, suggesting that college is much more beneficial for lower income students than for higher income students.\nAlthough the distributions’ central tendencies appear surprisingly close in value, subsequent two-sample t-tests report that the means for each category are significantly different from one another\n\nThis suggests that college may not be the economic equalizer that we suspect it is; however, the aforementioned benefit to lower income students cannot be discounted.\n\nInterestingly, students from the middle tercile are the only income group whose median median-earnings falls within the same bracket as their family’s\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nUsing a median aggregation function limits variability in post-graduation earnings, possibly erasing important patterns that do not appear in the final boxplot\nThe designated income groups are broad categories and thus may eliminate intra-group variability\n\nMore partitioning would provide a more nuanced depiction of how family income relates to post-graduation earnings\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart illustrates the racial composition of aided students by income group. Each income group ($0–$30K, $30K–$48K, $48K–$75K, $75K–$110K, $110K+) is represented on the x-axis, while the y-axis shows the proportional contributions of racial groups to the total number of aided students in that income group. The colors correspond to different racial groups, such as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.\n\nObservations & Conclusions\n\nThe largest proportion of aided students comes from the lowest income group ($0-\\30k)\nThe lowest income group shows a more diverse racial distribution compared to higher income groups\n\nWhile White students make up the majority in all income groups, racial minorities are present in notable proportions, especially in the lower income brackets\nAs income increases, the overall number of aided students decreases significantly\nThis figure touches on the role financial aid can play in bridging financial disparities, enabling students from low-income and underrepresented racial backgrounds to access higher education\nFinancial aid is essential in leveling the playing field for student from low-income backgrounds\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nThis figure assumes proportionality. It assumes that the racial composition of financial aid recipients within each income group is directly proportional to the overall racial composition of the institution. This may not reflect reality as financial aid distribution often varies based on additional factors like institutional policies, eligibility criteria, and systemic barriers that can favor or exclude certain racial groups.\nThe assumptions in this figure highlight the need for further data on whether aid is distributed equitably across racial and income groups.\nTherefore, this figure should be used as a general estimate rather than a precise measurement.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot illustrates the relationship between racial diversity of low income students (families earning less than $30,000 annually) are influenced by the racial composition of colleges, as measured by the proportion of underrepresented racial groups (1 - UGDS_WHITE). The x-axis represents the proportion of underrepresented racial groups in colleges, while the y-axis shows the withdrawal rate, which is defined as the percentage of low income who left their original institution within four years. By faceting the data by income level, this analysis focuses specifically on the low income students.\n\nObservations & Conclusions\n\nA slight downward trend in withdrawal rates is visible as racial diversity increases. This trend suggests that institutions with greater racial diversity may provide more supportive and inclusive environments for economically disadvantaged students, which could contribute to lower withdrawal rates.\nIn contrast, colleges with predominantly white students enrollments tend to show slightly higher withdrawal rates for low income students, while institutions with greater diversity show marginally better retention rates. The marginally better retention rates in more diverse colleges align with the idea that diverse racial composition might mitigate some of the challenges faced by low income students.\nThese findings support our thesis that racial disparities in family income are greater before college than after graduation. While low-income students face significant systemic barriers before enrolling in college, the diversity of their college may mitigate some of these challenges, improving retention rates during college.\nHowever, the modest slope of the loess trend line suggests that while institutional diversity is significant, its effect on withdrawal rates is relatively small. This highlights the importance of other factors, such as financial aid availability, campus resources, and academic support, in fostering student retention.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nIt is assumed that higher levels of racial diversity (1 - UGDS_WHITE) are associated with better student support for low-income students, but diverse institutions may still need to be equipped with adequate student support services.\nColleges in predominantly white areas may naturally have lower diversity and face unique retention challenges due to regional demographic differences.\nDifferent college policies, such as financial aid allocation, admissions criteria, and retention strategies, should be accounted for.\n1 - UGDS_WHITE does not capture the nuance of other racial groups or how race interacts with factors such as income, first-generation status, or academic ability.\nThe subtle trend in this figure suggests that racial diversity alone has a limited impact on retention. Other factors, such as faculty representation, curriculum inclusivity, and campus resources, may have a more significant impact.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n“Family Income vs. Median Earnings After 10 Years” shows the relationship between Median Family Income (pre-college financial background) and Median Earnings After 10 Years (post-college economic outcomes), grouped by SAT Categories (Low, Medium, High).\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 52 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 52 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations & Conclusions\nDiverse Financial Backgrounds: - The X-axis (Median Family Income) shows a wide spread, confirming that students come from a variety of financial backgrounds, from low-income families to high-income families. - All SAT categories (Low, Medium, High) have students distributed across the income spectrum, showing no strict correlation between SAT scores and family income. Less Variation in Economic Outcomes: - The Y-axis (Median Earnings After 10 Years) shows that earnings tend to converge, with most data points lying between $40,000 and $100,000. High SAT Category (Red): - Students with high SAT scores generally achieve higher earnings, especially at the upper end (&gt;$100,000). Medium SAT Category (Blue): - The earnings distribution overlaps significantly with the High SAT group, particularly in the $50,000–$80,000 range, showing that SAT scores alone do not fully determine outcomes. Low SAT Category (Green): - While earnings are generally lower for this group, many students still achieve earnings in the $40,000–$60,000 range, suggesting upward mobility. Earnings Convergence: - Despite the wide spread in family income (X-axis), there is less variation in earnings after 10 years (Y-axis), indicating that higher education helps reduce economic disparities over time.\n\n\nSupport for the Thesis\nDiverse Financial Backgrounds: - The wide range of family income reflects pre-college financial diversity. Less Variation in Outcomes: - Earnings converge within a narrower range, irrespective of family income or SAT category, indicating that students from different financial backgrounds achieve similar economic outcomes. The role of SAT scores: - While High SAT students tend to have slightly higher earnings, Medium and Low SAT students still achieve considerable economic mobility, suggesting that factors beyond academic preparedness (e.g., education quality, financial aid, and career opportunities) contribute to earnings equality.\n\n\nLimitations\nNo Regression Lines: - This limits our ability to assess the exact relationship between family income and earnings within each SAT category. Outliers and Scale: - Some outliers (e.g., earnings above $120,000) may skew the interpretation of central trends.\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows the relationship between racial diversity (proportion of underrepresented racial groups) and median student debt, split by three income categories: Low Income, Medium Income, and High Income.\n\nObservations & Conclusions\nLow-Income Students: - Median debt is highest for this group, reaching up to $30,000 in some cases. - The relationship between racial diversity and debt is relatively stable but shows slight fluctuations. - Students from more diverse colleges tend to have marginally higher debt.\nMedium-Income Students: - Median debt for medium-income students is generally lower than for low-income students, mostly staying under $20,000. - There is a slight upward trend in debt as racial diversity increases, especially at higher levels of diversity.\nHigh-Income Students: - High-income students have the lowest debt levels, typically staying below $15,000–$20,000. - The relationship between racial diversity and debt is weaker but shows mild non-linear behavior.\nOverall Trends: - Colleges with higher racial diversity tend to have slightly higher student debt across income groups. - Debt burden decreases as family income increases, highlighting the disproportionate impact of student loans on low-income families.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nThe analysis is limited to median debt and racial diversity, and other potential explanatory factors are not considered."

    "text": "We cleaned the data by manually going through the dataset and selecting columns that are relevant to our study. We were guided by information which may help highlight racial inequalities within the U.S.’s post-secondary education system. We focused on important variables such as completion rates for different races, percent of students who received Pell Grants, SAT and ACT test scores, and family income. The following is a preliminary analysis on of data after a first sweep of cleaning.\nA cursory inspection of the distribution of the share of faculty of each race shows no unusual observations. Although comparatively a rare occurrence, it is not surprising that a college’s entire faculty could be all Asian, Black, Hispanic, or White, as—for example—HBCUs and HCIs are common institutions. It appears that the distribution for each racial minority’s share of their school’s faculty is skewed right, whereas the distribution for White is slightly skewed left. Again, this aligns with our expectation: professorship seems to be a traditionally White role, historically offered only to those with wealth and privilege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot more White and Hispanic students being counted compared to Native Hawaiian/Pacific and Black students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis box plot shows differences in completion rates by race at four-year institutions. Asian students have the highest completion rates and Black students have the lowest completion rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot illustrates the distribution of undergraduate enrollment proportions across different racial and ethnic groups. This shows that White students are the most represented group, while AIAN and NHPI students have significantly lower representation."

    "text": "U.S. DOE College Scorecard https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/\nThere are 6485 rows and 3000+ columns in the dataset. The data was originally collected and compiled by the U.S. Department of Education on institution-level metrics for the 2022-23 academic year. The data is able to be loaded and cleaned. We hope to see if race is a factor in performance such as graduation rate and test scores. Additionally, we will measure the relationship between parents’ loan amounts, race, and college performance, in an attempt to highlight any financial barriers different races may face in coming to college. A potential challenge can be cleaning the data since there are over 3000+ columns of data.\nFreshman Intentions to Major in S&E Fields https://data.world/nsf/freshman-intentions-to-major-in-s-e-fields\nThere are 7 columns and 18 rows. It is collected by Higher Education Research Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, special tabulations (2014) of the Survey of the American Freshman. The intention of this dataset is to see American Freshman’s intentions to different majors by race and gender. The major question I hope to address is what are the most popular majors among American Freshman across different racial and gender groups. I am able to load and clean this dataset. My challenge is that there may be limitations because of insufficient data. The data is from one college in a year.\nMedical Student Mental Health https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/medical-student-mental-health?resource=download\nThere are 886 rows and 20 columns in the dataset and was designed to explore the empathy, mental health, and burnout levels of medical students in Switzerland. It consists of various demographic factors such as age, gender, year of study, along with internal measures like job satisfaction, empathy, depression, anxiety, and burnout levels. The data was collected through self-reported surveys and psychological tests. While the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, some minor cleaning may be needed to address missing data or outliers. We hope to examine whether health status and study hours are linked to depression and anxiety levels, and if years of study and job satisfaction influence burnout and empathy levels among the students."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are currently in the process of merging our supplementary dataset with our primary dataset. The primary dataset encompasses a range of racial, economic, and academic factors across all accredited colleges in the United States. To complement this, we have identified an additional dataset from the Bureau of Economic Analysis which provides state-level data on aggregate GDP and per capita GDP from years 1997 to 2023. Our goal in combining these datasets is to explore potential patterns between racial compositions among universities, state-level GDP, and changes in per capita GDP. We are investigating questions such as: Do states with more diverse college populations experience greater economic growth? In other words, can a more educated minority population, and consequently a more educated overall population, contribute to a state’s economic performance? After we finish cleaning our new dataset and appropriately augment it to our primary file, we will use techniques discussed in class to build plots which allow for a geographic visualization of college diversity’s association with state-level economic growth. As a consequence of limited time, we forfeited aspirations of finding a more complementary dataset and settled for a cross-analysis on education and GDP. Because we are not entirely confident that our GDP dataset will illuminate the most insightful conclusions, we maintain an open eye for possible datasets which better bridge together unintuitive relationships between race, education, and geographic location of colleges."

    "text": "Our tentative thesis is that racial disparities in family income are greater before college than in post-graduation salaries. In other words, while students enter college from diverse financial backgrounds, their economic outcomes after college show less variation. If, under scrutiny, our findings do align with our thesis, then the data suggests that college does, to some degree, mitigate systemic inequalities; however, if our conclusions are not as clear-cut, then there may be room to argue that college, as an economic instrument, is not as beneficial as we may have previously believed.\nThis first graph illustrates that, for all race categories, students whose family’s are in the upper two terciles earn significantly equal incomes by 10 years after graduation. Because average earnings are statistically similar for students whose families make $30,001-$75,000 and $75,001+, we have reason to suspect that college is effective in closing the economic-inequality gap, intra-racially. However, students whose families make less than $30,000 make a statistically significant amount less in post-graduation earnings, compared to their richer counterparts. Additionally, two interesting behaviors that we did not anticipate seeing are that, according to our local linear model, colleges with greater proportions of Black or Hispanic students are associated with lower average salaries after graduation (for all income terciles), compared to their Asian and White counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative view of the same data more clearly shows the relationships between average earnings after graduation and familial income. Although not faceted by race, the general conclusion is that the vast majority of students earn between $38,000 and $48,000 despite entering into college from families making less than $30,000 to families earning more than $75,000. So, although not yet a rigorously proven piece of evidence, this chart supports the idea that college is a powerful force in leveling the economic playing field in America.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 8145 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`)."

IPEDS gathers data from all institutions participating in federal student financial aid programs (Title IV), ensuring comprehensive coverage of postsecondary institutions in the U.S. The data is collected to improve transparency regarding college costs, graduation outcomes, and student debt, thereby helping students and their families make informed decisions about higher education. Policymakers also use this data for creating policies around higher education funding, affordability, and accountability The sample is focused only on Title IV institutions, which means schools not participating in federal aid programs may be excluded, so it might be biased. There are too many variables, which there are over 3,000 columns.

    "text": "This graph demonstrates the percentage change in population by year, for each state. (We would like to find a way to better represent this information so that the plot is less crowded by state-dependent information. A potential solution is to only include states with the greatest percent changes in population, or rather, if our claim encourages it, include all states with roughly constant growth to showcase a lack of erratic population explosions—but, we digress.) The first insight that this plot provides is that not all states are seeing increasing populations. Some states are experiencing repeated percent changes below that 0-change axis. We hope to use our racial education dataset and linear modeling to find an association between a state’s growth and available educational opportunities for minorities. Further, we will combine this population dataset with our GDP dataset to gleam a more nuanced picture of economic performance among the states. This allows for a better proxy of economic prosperity, which can be used in conjunction with our primary dataset to find influences of diverse college enrollment on a state’s economic growth.\nHere is our code and subsequent output from combining our GDP and population dataset, yielding an economic proxy.

Racial Composition of Aided Students\n\nLower-income groups ($0–$30K) display greater racial diversity with higher proportions of Black, Hispanic, and other underrepresented groups.\n\nAs family income increases, the racial composition shifts, with White students dominating higher income brackets.\n\nInsight: Financial aid plays a critical role in enabling access to higher education for underrepresented racial groups, particularly in lower income tiers.\n\n\n\n3. Retention Rates and Racial Diversity\n\nColleges with a higher proportion of underrepresented racial groups show slightly lower withdrawal rates for low-income students.\n\nA modest downward trend suggests that diverse environments support retention for economically disadvantaged students.\n\nInsight: Inclusive campuses can mitigate systemic barriers, though additional academic and financial support is still necessary to ensure student success.\n\n\n\n4. Family Income, SAT Scores, and Post-Graduation Outcomes\n\nFamily income has a strong positive correlation with median earnings after 10 years.\n\nStudents in the high SAT score group consistently achieve higher earnings, especially at higher family income levels.\n\nEarnings tend to converge for students from different SAT score groups, particularly in the $40K–$100K range.\n\nInsight: While family income drives post-graduation outcomes, SAT scores alone do not fully explain earnings disparities. Higher education helps reduce variation but does not eliminate income-based inequalities.\n\n\n\n5. Student Debt and Racial Diversity\n\nLow-income students from racially diverse campuses carry the highest debt burdens—up to $30,000.\n\nDebt burdens are lower for students from wealthier families, highlighting financial advantages in higher income groups.\n\nInsight: The disproportionate debt burden for racially diverse, low-income students exacerbates systemic inequalities, limiting their upward mobility despite higher education access."

    "text": "Conclusion:\nWhile colleges contribute to upward mobility, our findings reveal persistent economic and racial disparities:\n- Earnings gaps remain tied to family income.\n- Racial diversity improves access and retention but does not eliminate financial challenges.\n- Debt burdens disproportionately impact low-income and underrepresented racial groups.\nTo fulfill higher education’s promise of equity, institutions and policymakers must:\n1. Increase financial aid for low-income and racially diverse students.\n2. Enhance academic support to improve retention rates.\n3. Address systemic barriers to reduce student debt burdens.\nBy addressing these challenges, higher education can better serve as a true engine of opportunity for all students."

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."
