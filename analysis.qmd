## Introduction and Motivation
People often view higher education institutions as a significant pathway to reduce systemic inequalities and promote upward mobility. However, it remains uncertain how much a family's financial background and racial demographics affect things like dropout rates, academic readiness, and post-graduation earnings. This study evaluates how effectively higher education addresses these issues by analyzing family income, average student debt, racial composition, financial aid, and completion rates. Specifically, the focus is on whether higher education institutions reduce disparities in outcomes like retention and post-graduation earnings or if these disparities persist despite access to higher education.

This work supports the thesis that racial disparities in income differences are more considerable before people go to college than in post-graduation earnings. Additionally, it looks at how things before college, such as SAT/ACT scores, connect to economic mobility. This offers a better understanding of the role of higher education in mitigating systemic challenges in society.



## Statistical Model
Our motivation for research begs an obvious question: how can you measure whether one college is a better engine for economic equality than another? To address this, we developed a custom pseudo-variance metric that could quantify the inequality in post-graduation incomes partitioned on family income prior to entering college, for each observed college. Available data limits the partitioning to three categories: students hailing from families making below \$30,000 in annual household income (an approximation of the established poverty line), students from families making between \$30,001-\$75,000, and students from families making more than \$75,000. Traditional variance cannot be directly calculated for the three income brackets because the average of the three post-graduation incomes differs across colleges, making the variance influenced not only by the spread of the incomes but also by the central value. 

This pseudo-variance metric measures the aggregate percentage difference in median post-graduation incomes between the designated terciles, 10 years out of college. It is calculated by dividing the median earnings of each tercile by the maximum median of the three partitioned incomes, effectively standardizing the median incomes, then subtracting the sum of the standardized median incomes by the theoretical maximum. The smaller a college’s `var_measure`, the smaller the difference between the median incomes of the three terciles. For example, Boston University’s `var_measure` is 3.96, indicating that the university performs well in guaranteeing similar post-gradation incomes to all students regardless of their economic background. Compare this with East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, TN, which has a `var_measure` of 30.40, indicating that the aggregate difference between post-graduation incomes for each tertile is 30 percent. Through these examples, you can see that this metric provides a tailored way to evaluate inequalities in post-graduation income for each college.

Before building the model, our group evaluated our response variable under the scrutiny of MLR assumptions. Because the pseudo-$\chi^2$ nature of our `var_measure`, it was known that a quantile-quantile plot would reject the normally-distributed assumption. This was easily resolved using a square root transformation on the response variable. Subsequent Q-Q plots depicted a straight line with heavily tamed tails. Further, a Residual vs. Fitted plot illustrated a random scatter of points around zero, demonstrating homoscedasticity among error terms with expected value equal to zero. The final assumption regarding independence of observations is tricky to navigate, however we decided to ultimately move forward with the model but with more caution than we first anticipated. 

### Variable Selection
  Choosing predictors for this statistical model involved a lengthy processing method. The approximately 300 variables in the cleaned dataset were narrowed down to roughly thirty of greatest interest. The first issue variable selection posed was significant multicollinearity between predictors. Due to the proportional nature of the datatset, some variables were de facto categorical complements of other variables. To mitigate possible multicollinearity, we removed another subset of potential predictors. The resulting variables, with the exception of ones measuring racial proportions, all quantify financial factors pertaining specifically to the lowest income brackets. These include metrics such as the proportion of students awarded a Pell Grant, the percentage of federal student loan borrowers making progress on their loan, and the percentage of aided students whose family income is between \$0-\$30,000. A comprehensive list of these variables is presented below. The hypothesis being that if colleges are more financially supportive of their more economically fragile students, then they are likely better at closing post-graduation inequality gaps.
  
##### Model Variables 
 - **var_measure:** Pseudo-variance metric for measuring post-graduation income equality
 - **UGDS_BLACK:** Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are black
 - **UGDS_HISP:** Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are Hispanic
 - **UGDS_ASIAN:** Total share of enrollment of undergraduate degree-seeking students who are Asian
 - **FTFTPCTFLOAN_POOLED_SUPP:** Percentage of full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students awarded a federal loan
 - **INC_PCT_LO:** Percentage of aided students whose family income is between \$0-\$30,000
 - **INC_PCT_M1:** Percentage of aided students with family incomes between \$30,001-\$48,000
 - **INC_PCT_LO\*INC_PCT_M1:** Interaction term between `INC_PCT_LO` and `INC_PCT_M1`
 - **LO_INC_DEBT_MDN:** The median debt for students with family income between \$0-\$30,000"
 - **BBRR3_FED_PELL_MAKEPROG:** Percentage of Pell Grant recipient federal student loan borrowers making repayment progress after 3 years

We considered creating an interaction term between `BBRR3_FED_PELL_MAKEPROG` and `BBRR3_PP_PELL_MAKEPROG` (Percentage of Pell Grant recipient student Parent PLUS Loan borrowers making progress after 3 years) because of a suspected dependency between the variables. The theory is that if a student is making progress on paying their federal loans back then they are also likely making progress in paying their PLUS loans back; however, the resulting interaction term did not significantly contribute to model predictability, so it was not included in the final model. Moreover, the predictor `BBRR3_PP_PELL_MAKEPROG` had a p-value of nearly 1.0000, indicating an utterly insignificant relationship to our response variable. It would not be included in our final model.

The same suspected dependency between `INC_PCT_LO` and `INC_PCT_M1` encouraged us to include an interaction term between the two financial aid metrics. We theorized that colleges are likely awarding financial aid to similar proportions of students from the lower income brackets. This interaction term proved to play a significant role in improving our model so it stayed as a predictor.

We acknowledged the dependent nature of our race variables (as they measure proportions of a whole), but we decided to leave them in the final model because isolating the racial affects on our response variable outweighed possible multicollinearity issues. This problem of highly correlated predictors was mitigated by only focusing on a subset of the racial breakdown: the most frequent races among student populations, i.e. Black, Hispanic, and Asian.
  
### Results
The final model is represented by the following equation: 

${\small{\sqrt{var\_measure_i} = 10.6397 - 2.1601 \cdot UGDS\_BLACK\_i - 1.5554 \cdot UGDS\_HISP\_i - 2.0451 \cdot UGDS\_ASIAN\_i}}$
${\small + 1.5862 \cdot FTFTPCTFLOAN\_POOLED\_SUPP\_i - 6.5651 \cdot INC\_PCT\_LO\_i - 27.1280 \cdot INC\_PCT\_M1\_i}$
${\small + 51.8836 \cdot (INC\_PCT\_LO \cdot INC\_PCT\_M1)_i - 0.0001 \cdot LO\_INC\_DEBT\_MDN\_i}$ 
${\small - 7.3350 \cdot BBRR3\_FED\_PELL\_MAKEPROG\_i + \epsilon\_i}$ 

This multiple linear regression model has an adjusted correlation of determination of 0.2639308 and a RMSE of 1.145915, indicating that the average error is only 1.31 units off from a college’s true `var_measure` value. We believe the reason for such a low adjusted correlation of determination and RMSE is due to the narrow range of `sqrt(var_measure)`: nearly all values of the response variable fall between 2 and 8. Because there is little variance to explain, the adjusted $R^2$ and RMSE are naturally low. 

Interpretations of each of the nine predictor coefficients are provided below:

- $\beta_{BLACK} = -2.1601$: A one percentage point increase in the share of Black students at a college is associated with a 0.0005 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{HISP} = -1.5554$: A one percentage point increase in the share of Hispanic students at a college is associated with a 0.0002 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{ASIAN} = -2.0451$: A one percentage point increase in the share of Asian students at a college is associated with a 0.0004 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{PCTFLOAN} = 1.5862$: A one percentage point increase in percent of full-time undergraduate students at a college who are awarded a federal loan is associated with a 0.0003 unit increase in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{INC\_PCT\_LO} = -6.5651$: A one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between \$0-\$30,000 is associated with a 0.0043 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{INC\_PCT\_M1} = -27.1280$: A one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between \$30,001-\$48,000 is associated with a 0.0736 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{LO*M1} = 51.8836$: For a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between \$0-\$30,000, the effect of a one percentage point increase in percent of aided students at a college whose family income is between \$30,001-\$48,000 is associated with a 0.2692 unit increase in a college's `var_measure` (and vice versa).
- $\beta_{DEBT} = -0.0001$: A \$1,000 increase in the median debt for students with family income between \$0-\$30,000 is associated with a 0.1 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.
- $\beta_{MAKEPROG} = -7.3350$: A one percentage point increase in the percent of a college's Pell-Grant-recipient federal-student-loan borrowers making repayment progress after 3 years is associated with a 0.0054 unit decrease in a college's `var_measure`.

As the model suggests, more diverse college campuses are, counter-intuitively, associated with a lower `var_measure`, indicating greater equality in post-graduation earnings. We suspect this actually reads nothing about the college's capacity to help students, but is instead the natural consequence of less variation in the racial makeup of a school. If a university's student body is more diverse, we could expect more variation in post-graduation earnings, on grounds that race plays a societal role in finding jobs after college. A related and interesting finding was that the proportion of White students at a college had no statistically significant influence on `var_measure`.

Another curious finding, this time from the variable selection process, was that the proportion of students awarded a Pell Grant at a college was not significantly associated with a lower `var_measure` metric. This seems suspicious seeing that if a college has a greater share of students who have been awarded federal grants, one would predict that family income would play less of a role in determining a student's post-graduation income.

Although the assumptions for linear regression do hold, albeit loosely, there are some factors which further limit the certainty of our conclusions. First is our `var_measure` variable. Although the pseudo-variance metric does give a rough proxy for measuring disparities between post-graduation earnings between students by income bracket, it is not a mathematically rigorous estimation. Future research could benefit from a weighted metric that places more weight on different income brackets being closer or further from the median post-graduation earnings. Moreover, the `var_measure` variable is constructed by finding variance between three median values. This averaging-pipeline of averages of averages only gives crude estimations of the true metric of interest. Future exploration should look for college data banks which report all available incomes of its graduates, measured before any aggregate functions have been applied. In a similar vain, the second factor which heavily limits accurate predictions is the proportional and aggregate nature of the dataset. It's impossible to find much disparity between each college's predictor values because each college-level measurement has already been regressed towards some average value. This lack of variance in each predictor likely affected our ability to describe variation within the response variable, causing the predictability of the model to fall short. With this is mind, we can confidently state that this model does provide a rough proxy for the relationship between certain economic factors, educational burdens, race, and post-graduation income inequality.

```
The above boxplots highlight the main focus of our research: the variation in post-graduation earnings by a student's family income. The three distributions showcase the varying post-graduate earnings of students from the lowest income tercile to the highest tercile. The horizontal axis indicates the income group while the vertical axis reports the median post-graduation earning. 

#### Observations & Conclusions

 - Median earnings increase as family income increases
 - Each distribution is skewed right, indicating that few colleges enable the median student to earn more than roughly \$60,000 in annual earnings. This is likely the result of aggregate data which suppresses variation.
 - The median median-post-graduation earnings for the lowest tercile (\$0-\$30,000) is \$39,666 but only \$53,367 for the highest tercile, suggesting that college is much more beneficial for lower income students than for higher income students.
 - Although the distributions' central tendencies appear surprisingly close in value, subsequent two-sample t-tests report that the means for each category are significantly different from one another
    - This suggests that college may not be the economic equalizer that we suspect it is; however, the aforementioned benefit to lower income students cannot be discounted.
 - Interestingly, students from the middle tercile are the only income group whose median median-earnings falls within the same bracket as their family's

#### Limitations

 - Using a median aggregation function limits variability in post-graduation earnings, possibly erasing important patterns that do not appear in the final boxplot
 - The designated income groups are broad categories and thus may eliminate intra-group variability
    - More partitioning would provide a more nuanced depiction of how family income relates to post-graduation earnings

The stacked bar chart illustrates the racial composition of aided students by income group. Each income group (\$0–\$30K, \$30K–\$48K, \$48K–\$75K, \$75K–\$110K, \$110K+) is represented on the x-axis, while the y-axis shows the proportional contributions of racial groups to the total number of aided students in that income group. The colors correspond to different racial groups, such as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.

#### Observations & Conclusions  

 - The largest proportion of aided students comes from the lowest income group (\$0-\30k)
 - The lowest income group shows a more diverse racial distribution compared to higher income groups  
 - While White students make up the majority in all income groups, racial minorities are present in notable proportions, especially in the lower income brackets 
 - As income increases, the overall number of aided students decreases significantly
 - This figure touches on the role financial aid can play in bridging financial disparities, enabling students from low-income and underrepresented racial backgrounds to access higher education
 - Financial aid is essential in leveling the playing field for student from low-income backgrounds 
 
#### Limitations 

  - This figure assumes proportionality. It assumes that the racial composition of financial aid recipients within each income group is directly proportional to the overall racial composition of the institution. This may not reflect reality as financial aid distribution often varies based on additional factors like institutional policies, eligibility criteria, and systemic barriers that can favor or exclude certain racial groups. 
  - The assumptions in this figure highlight the need for further data on whether aid is distributed equitably across racial and income groups.
  - Therefore, this figure should be used as a general estimate rather than a precise measurement.

```
This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between racial diversity of low income students (families earning less than $30,000 annually) are influenced by the racial composition of colleges, as measured by the proportion of underrepresented racial groups (1 - UGDS_WHITE). The x-axis represents the proportion of underrepresented racial groups in colleges, while the y-axis shows the withdrawal rate, which is defined as the percentage of low income who left their original institution within four years. By faceting the data by income level, this analysis focuses specifically on the low income students.

#### Observations & Conclusions 

 - A slight downward trend in withdrawal rates is visible as racial diversity increases. This trend suggests that institutions with greater racial diversity may provide more supportive and inclusive environments for economically disadvantaged students, which could contribute to lower withdrawal rates. 
 - In contrast, colleges with predominantly white students enrollments tend to show slightly higher withdrawal rates for low income students, while institutions with greater diversity show marginally better retention rates.
The marginally better retention rates in more diverse colleges align with the idea that diverse racial composition might mitigate some of the challenges faced by low income students.
 - These findings support our thesis that racial disparities in family income are greater before college than after graduation. While low-income students face significant systemic barriers before enrolling in college, the diversity of their college may mitigate some of these challenges, improving retention rates during college. 
 - However, the modest slope of the loess trend line suggests that while institutional diversity is significant, its effect on withdrawal rates is relatively small. This highlights the importance of other factors, such as financial aid availability, campus resources, and academic support, in fostering student retention.

#### Limitations 

  - It is assumed that higher levels of racial diversity (1 - UGDS_WHITE) are associated with better student support for low-income students, but diverse institutions may still need to be equipped with adequate student support services.
  - Colleges in predominantly white areas may naturally have lower diversity and face unique retention challenges due to regional demographic differences.
  - Different college policies, such as financial aid allocation, admissions criteria, and retention strategies, should be accounted for.
  - 1 - UGDS_WHITE does not capture the nuance of other racial groups or how race interacts with factors such as income, first-generation status, or academic ability.
  - The subtle trend in this figure suggests that racial diversity alone has a limited impact on retention. Other factors, such as faculty representation, curriculum inclusivity, and campus resources, may have a more significant impact.
