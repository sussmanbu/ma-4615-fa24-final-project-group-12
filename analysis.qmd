The stacked bar chart illustrates the racial composition of aided students by income group. Each income group ($0–$30K, $30K–$48K, $48K–$75K, $75K–$110K, $110K+) is represented on the x-axis, while the y-axis shows the proportional contributions of racial groups to the total number of aided students in that income group. The colors correspond to different racial groups, such as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.

## Observations & Conclusions  

 - The largest proportion of aided students comes from the lowest income group ($0-30k)
 - The lowest income group shows a more diverse racial distribution compared to higher income groups  
 - While White students make up the majority in all income groups, racial minorities are present in notable proportions, especially in the lower income brackets 
 - As income increases, the overall number of aided students decreases significantly
 - This figure touches on the role financial aid can play in bridging financial disparities, enabling students from low-income and underrepresented racial backgrounds to access higher education
 - Financial aid is essential in leveling the playing field for student from low-income backgrounds 
 
## Limitations 

  - This figure assumes proportionality. It assumes that the racial composition of financial aid recipients within each income group is directly proportional to the overall racial composition of the institution. This may not reflect reality as financial aid distribution often varies based on additional factors like institutional policies, eligibility criteria, and systemic barriers that can favor or exclude certain racial groups. 
  - The assumptions in this figure highlight the need for further data on whether aid is distributed equitably across racial and income groups.
  - Therefore, this figure should be used as a general estimate rather than a precise measurement.

```
This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between racial diversity of low income students (families earning less than $30,000 annually) are influenced by the racial composition of colleges, as measured by the proportion of underrepresented racial groups (1 - UGDS_WHITE). The x-axis represents the proportion of underrepresented racial groups in colleges, while the y-axis shows the withdrawal rate, which is defined as the percentage of low income who left their original institution within four years. By faceting the data by income level, this analysis focuses specifically on the low income students.

## Observations & Conclusions 

 - A slight downward trend in withdrawal rates is visible as racial diversity increases. This trend suggests that institutions with greater racial diversity may provide more supportive and inclusive environments for economically disadvantaged students, which could contribute to lower withdrawal rates. 
 - In contrast, colleges with predominantly white students enrollments tend to show slightly higher withdrawal rates for low income students, while institutions with greater diversity show marginally better retention rates.
The marginally better retention rates in more diverse colleges align with the idea that diverse racial composition might mitigate some of the challenges faced by low income students.
 - These findings support our thesis that racial disparities in family income are greater before college than after graduation. While low-income students face significant systemic barriers before enrolling in college, the diversity of their college may mitigate some of these challenges, improving retention rates during college. 
 - However, the modest slope of the loess trend line suggests that while institutional diversity is significant, its effect on withdrawal rates is relatively small. This highlights the importance of other factors, such as financial aid availability, campus resources, and academic support, in fostering student retention.

## Limitations 

  - It is assumed that higher levels of racial diversity (1 - UGDS_WHITE) are associated with better student support for low-income students, but diverse institutions may still need to be equipped with adequate student support services.
  - Colleges in predominantly white areas may naturally have lower diversity and face unique retention challenges due to regional demographic differences.
  - Different college policies, such as financial aid allocation, admissions criteria, and retention strategies, should be accounted for.
  - 1 - UGDS_WHITE does not capture the nuance of other racial groups or how race interacts with factors such as income, first-generation status, or academic ability.
  - The subtle trend in this figure suggests that racial diversity alone has a limited impact on retention. Other factors, such as faculty representation, curriculum inclusivity, and campus resources, may have a more significant impact.

  

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc. 

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points.
If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. 
I don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind.
Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't describe your whole process.

### Example of loading data

The code below shows an example of loading the loan refusal data set (which you should delete at some point).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
print(getwd())
data <- read_rds(here::here("dataset/loan_refusal_clean.rds"))
```

## Note on Attribution

In general, you should try to provide links to relevant resources, especially those that helped you. You don't have to link to every StackOverflow post you used but if there are explainers on aspects of the data or specific models that you found helpful, try to link to those. Also, try to link to other sources that might support (or refute) your analysis. These can just be regular hyperlinks. You don't need a formal citation.

If you are directly quoting from a source, please make that clear. You can show quotes using `>` like this

    -   Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
    -   What questions are you interested in answering?
    -   Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
-   Modeling and Inference
    -   The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
    -   Explain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)
    -   Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
-   Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
    -   Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
